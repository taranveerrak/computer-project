<H1>Manipur – Culture and Tradition</H1>

<H3>Manipur is a northeastern state in India, with Imphal it’s capital. It is one of the seven sister states of India and literally means “A Jeweled land” and is also called as “Switzerland of the East“. This region may not really have the mine of the Gems, but its natural beauty comes only after Kashmir in India, which is not wrong to say the state of the Gems and Jewels.</H3></body>

<H3>Manipur is bounded by Nagaland to the north, Mizoram to the south, and Assam to the west and Myanmar to the east. The seven sister states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura which have a unique culture with ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity. Apart from being a nature’s gift to India, Manipur is also a melting pot of culture. It is the birthplace of polo, the sport and the birthplace of Ras Lila, a classical dance form.</H3></body>

<H3>Manipur has a long glorious history even before the beginning of the Cristian era. Manipur is mentioned in Mahabharata where Chitrangada, one of Arjuna’s wives was from the kingdom of Manipura. There are many theories about the origin of the Meitei people, but many anthropologists and historians believe that they are Tibeto-Burmese people who came and settled in the Imphal valley. Many kings ruled Manipur and Manipur’s independence and sovereignty remained until the early 19th century.</H3>

<H3>The history of the Miti king of Manipur is found in Puyas, some people also call Puyas as Puwaris. It contains information about Ningthau Kangbalon, Chitharol Kumbaba, Ningtharol Lambuba, Poretan Khunathokpa, Panthoibi Khongkul in the Mitti script. This complete information has been written by the Miti king Maharaja and learned people of his time.</H3>

<H3>The people living in the hill have their own folk tales and stories. Manipur was recognized by different names at different times, such as Tili Koktong, Pori Lam, Sanna Leepak, Mitrabak and now Manipur.</H3>

<H3>The name of its capital was Kangla, Yumphal. Today the capital of Manipur is called Imphal. People of this state are called by many names such as Miti, Piri Miti, Maiti and Miti.</H3>

<H3>Ningthau Kangba was the first king of Manipur. BCE 1129-BCE 44 when there was no king in the country, there was an uproar on all sides. For the first time in history, Manipur became a slave in the Anglo Manipuri war at Khongjom in 1891.
